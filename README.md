Doing Data Science Case Study 1


Executive Summary:

Frito Lay partnered with DDSAnalytics to tackle the issue of employee turnover. This analysis aimed to identify the key factors contributing to attrition and build models to predict which employees are at a higher risk of leaving.  By reducing turnover, Frito Lay can lower high replacement costs, estimated at 50% to 400% of an individual’s salary, and improve overall workforce stability.

1. Key Findings
  - Top Factors
    o	Job Involvement: Employees with low job involvement are far more likely to leave the company.
    o	Overtime: Employees with more overtime are more likely to leave the company.
    o	Marital Status: Single Individuals are more likely to leave the company.
  - Predictive Model Performance
    o	Models Used: Various classification models were tested (KNN and NB).
    o	Accuracy & Cost Savings: The chosen model accurately identifies at-risk employees and indicates potential for significant cost savings when retention strategies are implemented.
  - Financial Impact
    •	Replacement Cost: Attrition can cost 50–400% of the departing employee’s annual salary.
    •	Retention Incentive: A $200 investment in proactive engagement can prevent a large percentage of high-risk employees from leaving.  Even modest reductions in attrition result in considerable net savings given the high replacement costs.
  
2. Recommendations
  - Implement Targeted Retention Programs: Use model outputs to focus on at-risk employees.
  - Ongoing Monitoring & Model Updates: Retrain and refine the predictive model regularly with new data to maintain accuracy and adjust strategies as needed.
